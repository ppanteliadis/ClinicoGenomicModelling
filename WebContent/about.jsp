				<h2><strong>Computer Science Department</strong></h2>
				<p>The <a href="http://www.csd.uoc.gr/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department</a> at the 
				<a href="http://www.uoc.gr/" target="_blank">University of Crete</a> dates back to <strong>1984</strong>,
				historically the second Computer Science Department to operate in Greece.
				Since <strong>1985</strong>, a complete graduate studies program has been in existence,
				including a full spectrum of graduate courses. From the Department's very
				beginning, close cooperation was cultivated with the <a href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/" target="_blank">Institute of Computer Science</a> (<a href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/">ICS</a>) of the <a href="http://www.forth.gr/" target="_blank">Foundation
				for Research and Technology</a>, Hellas (<a href="http://www.forth.gr/" target="_blank">FORTH</a>).
				<br>
				<br>
				Over the years the Department has pursued joint work with dozens of
				universities, research centres and companies. The Department's close relations
				with <a href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/">ICS</a>-<a href="http://www.forth.gr/" target="_blank">FORTH</a>,
				which was incidentally the first Greek Internet node, have assured it an
				international reputation. Today, more than twenty years after its emergence, the
				Department graduates hold top-notch business, industrial, educational, research
				and academic positions in Greece,
				Europe and many other parts of the world.</p>
